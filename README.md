2. Install the required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## File Descriptions

| File | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| **db_after_threshold_pretrain_2cnn_sepa.py** | Main script that reproduce the double-training experiment results (without visualization). |
| **image.py** | Contains helper functions for image stimulus generation. |
| **network.py** | Defines functions related to the neural network architecture. 
| **tool_gabor.py** | Provides general Gabor filter tools. |
| **tool_gabor_45.py** | Another version of tool_gabor.py. |
| **utils.py** | Contains miscellaneous utility functions used across the project, such as file handling, logging, and other common tasks that simplify coding and improve code readability. |

## Usage
